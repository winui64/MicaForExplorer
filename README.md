<h2 align=center>Install/Uninstall</h2>

### Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release**
   - Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/DRKCTRLDEV/Mica4U/releases) and download the latest `Mica4U` installer (`.exe`).
2. **Run the Installer**
   - Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - The installer will automatically place all necessary files and create shortcuts if selected.
3. **Requirements**
   - Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
   - No additional dependencies required; all necessary components are bundled.

### Portable Mode
- You can also use the portable version by extracting the release `.zip` and running `Mica4U.exe` directly. No installation is required.

### Uninstallation

- **If Installed via Installer:**
  1. Open the Windows *Settings* app or *Control Panel*.
  2. Navigate to *Apps* > *Installed apps* (or *Programs and Features*).
  3. Find **Mica4U** in the list, select it, and click **Uninstall**.
  4. Follow the prompts to remove the application.
- **If Using Portable Version:**
  - Simply delete the extracted folder to remove all files.
  - **Important:** Before deleting the portable folder to uninstall, ensure you have unregistered the DLL from within Mica4U (use the  "Uninstall" option). This prevents file locking (inability to delete).

> **Note:** Custom settings and presets are stored in the application's directory or `%APPDATA%/Mica4U`. Delete these folders if you wish to remove all user data. (Or click 'Yes' to cleaning up setttings in the uninstaller)

<h2 align=center>Build From Source</h2>

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.12+** ([python.org](https://www.python.org/))
- **pip** (comes with Python)
- **PyQt6** and **PyInstaller**

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DRKCTRLDEV/Mica4U.git
   cd Mica4U
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Or manually:
   pip install PyQt6 PyInstaller
   ```
3. **Build the Executable**
   ```sh
   ./build.ps1
   # Or manually:
   pyinstaller build/Mica4U.spec
   ```
   The executable(s) will be in `build/output/`.
   > **Versioning:** You can specify a version as an argument: `./build.ps1 x.x.x`

4. **Run the Application**
   For development, launch `main.py`:
     ```sh
     python main.py
     ```
     > **Note:** To use in this form, you must run as administrator and have a `portable.ini` file in the same directory. You can also build the portable version and substitute `Mica4U.exe` with `main.py`, but this will not auto-elevate.
   Or run the built executable from `build/output/`.
